Use the docker scripts to do things. You shouldn't need to rebuild, but if you let the running container stop then you'll need to `start` it again. If for some reason you need to `run` it again, remember that it'll steal your terminal. Just `ctrl-c` and then run the `start` script to get to where you need to be.
